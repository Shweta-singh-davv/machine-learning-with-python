This repository showcases various projects completed by me in the field of machine learning. Below are the details of the projects I have undertaken:

## Book Recommendation System
### Introduction
This project aims to create a book recommendation system for users using a popularity-based measure. The system recommends similar books based on the popularity and taste of the user, leveraging the concept of cosine similarity.

### Features- 
Popularity-Based Recommendations: Recommends books based on popularity metrics. Cosine Similarity: Utilizes cosine similarity to find books similar to the input book title. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Includes EDA to understand the dataset better before building the recommendation system. Libraries Used numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,scikit-learn

Dataset-- The dataset includes user ratings for various books. It has been filtered to include: Books that have received at least 50 ratings. Users who have rated 200 or more books.

Usage-- To use the recommendation system, simply call the recommend function with the title of the book you want recommendations for. The system will output the top 5 books similar to the input book title based on popularity and cosine similarity.

Conclusion-- This Book Recommendation System efficiently recommends books to users based on their popularity and similarity. It demonstrates the use of various Python libraries and machine learning techniques to build a functional recommendation engine.
